# Bin packing using ACO

The task for this assignment is the implementation of the ant colony optimisation (ACO) algorithm
to the problem of bin packing. 

The packing problem statements are:
BBP1 = 500 items of weights of i, where i equal to the item number (eg item 2 = weight 2). 
These items are to be packed into 10 bins.

BPP2 = 500 items of weights of i^2, where i equal to the item number 2 (eg item 2 = weight (2^2) = 4).
These items are to be packed into 50 bins.
